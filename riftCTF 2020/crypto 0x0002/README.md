From first glance we know that it is a substitution cipher, since the length of the encrypted flag is the same as the plaintext.
Going to the URL we see Mr Louis Nyffenegger. Since we have a key it points to it being a Vignere Cipher. 

Plugging in egkyGGJ{Q3e_Xf_FshH3wf} and NYFFENEGGER as the key we will get :
