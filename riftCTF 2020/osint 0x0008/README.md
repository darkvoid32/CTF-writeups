> We've been deploying drones to photograph the South Wales region for some time. The analysis team has been picking through the mass of imagery we've got from this activity.

> We're particularly interested in confirming the sighting of one of our most critical targets.

> Fortunately, one of those Google cars with cameras mounted to the roof appears to have been sailing by at the time. Perhaps this might help you?

> So we can be confident we've actually spotted them, can you confirm the COLOUR of their HOODIE and the COLOUR of their T-SHIRT.

> You only have five attempts, so make sure you don't just guess!
