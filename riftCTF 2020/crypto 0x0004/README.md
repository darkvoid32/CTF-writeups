This is the maritime signal code encyrption, going online and finding any decrypter we will get :

> riftctfjusta7t1but3t0armedforces

Flag doesnt work on the site though, this ctf sucks .-. (tried normal flag format and other stuff)

Note : After looking at other writeups the flag was : 

> riftCTF{Just_A_7r1but3_t0_armedForces}

In the end the flag needed guessing, even though I solved it...
